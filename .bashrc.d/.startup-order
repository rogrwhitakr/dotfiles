bash startup order
-> Executes A, then B, then C
-> of B1, B2, B3 are executed only the first of those files found.

So typically (or sooner or later), what you will encounter are non-login shells. 
So this case is what you should write your config files for. 
This means putting most of your stuff in ~/.bashrc, having exactly one of 
    ~/.bash_profile,
    ~/.bash_login,
    ~/.profile, 
and sourcing 
    ~/.bashrc
from it. If you have nothing that you specifically want to happen only for login shells, 
you can even symlink one of the three to ~/.bashrc. 
In fact, even if you do, it is probably a good idea to have only file, as follows:

# Bash customisation file

#General configuration starts: stuff that you always want executed

#General configuration ends

if [[ -n $PS1 ]]; then
    : # These are executed only for interactive shells
    echo "interactive"
else
    : # Only for NON-interactive shells
fi

if shopt -q login_shell ; then
    : # These are executed only when it is a login shell
    echo "login"
else
    : # Only when it is NOT a login shell
    echo "nonlogin"
fi


Almost everything should go in the “general configuration” section. 
There might be some commands (those which produce output, etc.) that you only want 
executed when the shell is interactive, and not in scripts, 
which you can put in the first “conditional section”. 
I don’t see any reason to use the rest. 
You can drop the “echo” lines, but keep the “:”s — they are commands which do nothing, 
and are needed if that section is empty.
