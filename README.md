Dotfiles

i should have a simple script to 

1. pull the repo
2. move the files where i need them without further configuration need

```bash

git clone xy
mv xy to z

```

**OR**

```bash

curl <some script that is part of the repo>
chmod u+x <script>

# i can trust it to do little harm
./<script>

```
